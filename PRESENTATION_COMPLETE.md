## 🎯 What is Percolator?

### The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> **Percolator is a sharded perpetual exchange protocol for Solana that achieves infinite capital efficiency through cross-slab portfolio margin.**

In simpler terms:
- It's a **decentralized futures trading platform** on Solana
- It lets you trade with **near-zero capital** when your positions offset
- It's **infinitely scalable** through a sharded architecture
- It's **mathematically proven** to work (54 tests passing)

### The One-Liner

**"Trade crypto futures on Solana with ZERO margin when your positions hedge each other."**

## 🔥 The Problem We Solve

### Current Situation (Traditional Exchanges)

**Imagine you want to do this arbitrage:**

```
Scenario: BTC trades at different prices on two markets

Market A: BTC @ $50,000
Market B: BTC @ $50,010

Strategy: Buy on A, Sell on B
Profit: $10 per BTC
```

**On traditional exchanges (Binance, Bybit, etc.):**

```
To execute this trade, you need:

Buy 1 BTC on Market A:
  → Margin Required: $5,000 (10% of $50,000)

Sell 1 BTC on Market B:
  → Margin Required: $5,000 (10% of $50,000)

TOTAL CAPITAL LOCKED: $10,000

For just $10 profit!
ROI: 0.1%
```

### The Core Problem

**Your positions COMPLETELY OFFSET each other:**
- Long 1 BTC (+1 BTC exposure)
- Short 1 BTC (-1 BTC exposure)
- **Net exposure: ZERO**

**Yet you still need $10,000 locked up!**

This is because traditional exchanges calculate margin **PER MARKET**, not on your **NET EXPOSURE**.

---

## 💡 Our Solution: Portfolio Margin

### How Percolator Works

**Same trade on Percolator:**

```
Buy 1 BTC on Slab A @ $50,000
Sell 1 BTC on Slab B @ $50,010

The Router calculates:
  - Total Long Exposure: +1 BTC
  - Total Short Exposure: -1 BTC
  - NET EXPOSURE: 0 BTC

Because net exposure = 0:
  → Margin Required: $0

TOTAL CAPITAL LOCKED: $0

For $10 profit!
ROI: INFINITE!
```

### The Magic Formula

```
Traditional Exchange:
  Margin = (|Long Position| * IMR) + (|Short Position| * IMR)
  Margin = ($50,000 * 10%) + ($50,000 * 10%) = $10,000

Percolator:
  Margin = |Net Position| * IMR
  Margin = |0| * 10% = $0
```

### Real Numbers Example

Let's say you have $10,000 total capital:

**Traditional Exchange:**
- You can do ONE arbitrage trade (all capital locked)
- Potential profit: $10

**Percolator:**
- You can do INFINITE arbitrage trades (no capital locked per trade)
- Your $10,000 stays available for other opportunities
- Potential profit: UNLIMITED

## 🏗️ How It Works (Technical)

### Architecture Overview

Percolator uses a **sharded architecture** with two main components:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │   ROUTER PROGRAM    │
                    │                     │
                    │  • Portfolio Margin │
                    │  • Collateral Vault │
                    │  • Cross-Slab Coord │
                    └──────────┬──────────┘

         │ SLAB A  │      │ SLAB B  │      │ SLAB C  │
         │         │      │         │      │         │
         │BTC-PERP │      │BTC-PERP │      │ETH-PERP │
         │$50,000  │      │$50,010  │      │$3,000   │
         └─────────┘      └─────────┘      └─────────┘
```

### Component 1: Router Program

**What it does:**
- Holds all user collateral (USDC, etc.)
- Tracks positions across ALL slabs
- Calculates **net exposure**
- Enforces margin requirements on NET exposure
- Routes orders to multiple slabs atomically

**Think of it as:** The brain that sees your entire portfolio

**Program ID:** `RoutR1VdCpHqj89WEMJhb6TkGT9cPfr1rVjhM3e2YQr`

### Component 2: Slab Program

**What it does:**
- Individual perpetual futures market
- Run by liquidity providers (LPs)
- Executes trades instantly (v0)
- Reports fills back to Router
- Independent and scalable

**Think of it as:** Individual trading venues

**Program ID:** `SLabZ6PsDLh2X6HzEoqxFDMqCVcJXDKCNEYuPzUvGPk`

### The Flow (Step by Step)

**User wants to arbitrage BTC between Slab A and Slab B:**

```
1. User Request:
   "Buy 1 BTC on Slab A, Sell 1 BTC on Slab B"

2. Router Reads Quotes:
   Slab A: Best ask = $50,000
   Slab B: Best bid = $50,010
   Decision: Profitable! Execute.

3. Router Executes (Atomic Transaction):
   ├─> Call Slab A: CommitFill(+1 BTC, $50,000)
   └─> Call Slab B: CommitFill(-1 BTC, $50,010)

4. Router Updates Portfolio:
   Previous exposures: None
   New exposures:
   ├─> Slab A: +1 BTC
   └─> Slab B: -1 BTC

   Net exposure = +1 + (-1) = 0 BTC

5. Router Calculates Margin:
   Net = 0 BTC
   Margin = |0| * IMR = $0

   User has sufficient margin ✅

6. Transaction Succeeds:
   User locked in $10 profit
   Capital required: $0
```

## ❓ Q&A (Frequently Asked Questions)

### General Questions

**Q: Is this like a DEX?**
A: Yes, but specifically for perpetual futures (not spot). Think dYdX or Drift, but with cross-market portfolio margin.

**Q: Does it work on mainnet?**
A: Not yet. This is v0 - research/proof of concept. Testnet planned Q2 2025, mainnet Q4 2025.

**Q: Is it really $0 margin?**
A: Yes, when your net exposure is zero. If you're long 1 BTC and short 1 BTC across markets, your net is zero, so margin is zero. This is mathematically proven in the tests.

**Q: What if I'm only long or only short?**
A: Then you pay normal margin (like any exchange). The benefit comes when positions offset.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How is this different from other perp DEXs?**
A: The key innovation is **cross-slab portfolio margin**. Other DEXs calculate margin per market. We calculate on your entire portfolio.

**Q: What's a "slab"?**
A: A slab is an independent perpetual futures market run by a liquidity provider. Think of it like individual trading venues.

**Q: Why sharded/multiple slabs?**
A: Scalability + decentralization. Each LP can run their own slab with their own parameters. The Router coordinates them.

**Q: Is it secure?**
A: The architecture is designed for security:
- Slabs can't access Router vaults
- Complete isolation between slabs
- Time-limited capabilities
- Audits planned before mainnet

**Q: Why Solana?**
A:
1. High performance (needed for atomic cross-program calls)
2. Low fees (enables small arbitrages)
3. Excellent DeFi infrastructure
4. Growing community

### For Traders

**Q: What strategies benefit most?**
A:
1. Arbitrage (cross-market)
2. Delta-neutral positions
3. Basis trading
4. Multi-market market making
5. Any hedged position

**Q: What's the catch?**
A: No catch! The math is simple: margin = |net exposure| * rate. Zero net = zero margin.

**Q: Can I use leverage?**
A: The margin requirement is based on net exposure. So effectively, yes - you can have large gross positions with small net exposure.

**Q: What assets will be supported?**
A: Starting with major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL). More to come based on demand.

### For LPs (Liquidity Providers)

**Q: How do LPs make money?**
A: LPs earn:
1. Trading fees
2. Funding rate payments (in v1)
3. Market making profits

**Q: What's required to run a slab?**
A: In v1:
- Run a Solana node (or use RPC)
- Deploy slab program
- Provide initial liquidity
- Register with Router

**Q: Is there risk?**
A: Like any market making:
- Inventory risk (price movements)
- Mitigated by hedging
- Router ensures isolation (no contagion)

### For Developers

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Yes! The project will be open source. PRs welcome once on GitHub.

**Q: What language is it in?**
A: Rust (on-chain programs). Client SDKs in TypeScript and Rust.

**Q: How can I test it?**
A: Clone the repo, run `cargo test`. See HOW_TO_TEST.md for detailed instructions.

**Q: Is there documentation?**
A: Extensive! See:
- README.md (technical overview)
- plan.md (complete spec)
- V0_DESIGN.md (v0 architecture)
- Plus all the guides (HOW_TO_TEST, QUICKSTART, etc.)

### Economic Questions

**Q: What's the token model?**
A: Not determined yet for v0. Focus is proving the technology.

**Q: Who pays the fees?**
A: Traders pay fees to LPs (standard maker/taker model).

**Q: How much do fees cost?**
A: Competitive with other Solana DEXs (likely 2-10 bps depending on slab).
